                    <Code>https://npm-diff.app/lodash@4.17.0...~4.17.15</Code>

                . If you go to any URL which is not exact, and therefore can
                change over time, we will redirect you to the exact URL. You
                will be redirected to an exact, canonical URL. This means you
                will get a cached version even if you used a unique query.
